# Fake-News-Classification-Challenge

This repository contains three approaches for tackling the fake news classification challenge. These approaches are:
1. Cosine Similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of headline and body. 
2. Conditional Encoding of the headline LSTM layer and body LSTM layer
3. DistilBERT 

DistilBERT achieved an accuracy of 9739.50 which beats the baseline fnc-1 classification model.
